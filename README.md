# Bookstore React App

## Key Technical Choices

- **React with TypeScript** for type safety and scalability.
- **React Router** for navigation.
- **Context API** for global cart state management.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd bookstore
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
